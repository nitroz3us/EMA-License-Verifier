# EMA-License-Verifier
A web scraper to check valid licenses in Energy Market Authority (EMA) website.
## Problem Statement
We often see stickers and advertisements on Handyman services (for electrical works, plumbing, etc) plastered all over lifts and void decks. Such services are also advertised online. 
However, there is no easy way for individuals to verify whether these contractors are licensed. Hence, there would be a higher chance of service dissatisfaction and poor workmanship. Engaging unlicensed or inexperienced service providers may even result in danger during and after the service is provided.
## Solution (Currently Electricians only)
A tool to verify Handyman services from licensed contractors.
